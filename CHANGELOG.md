Notes:
Fully implemented the [ton-footstep](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/224). A big thanks for the patience of everyone involved and a big sorry — for the delays.

It's already a very broad and useful SDK that is capable for bringing the Dart/Flutter and TON Blockchain together. And I will continue updating this library, so that it would bring even more value to both ecosystems!

Looking forward to projects built using this SDK :)

Plans for future development:
- Better unit test coverage
- More examples/tutorials
- Caching for TonJsonRpc, especially for shards and shard transactions
- DNS resolutions, especially using Ton Domains as wallet address shorthands
- ADNL client
- ...and a lot more — stay tuned!
